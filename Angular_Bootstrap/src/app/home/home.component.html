  <h1>Education System</h1>
  <p class="lead">
 The term education system generally refers to public schooling, not private schooling, and more commonly to kindergarten through high school programs. Schools or school districts are typically the smallest recognized form of “education system” and countries are the largest. States are also considered to have education systems.
Simply put, an education system comprises everything that goes into educating public-school students at the federal, state, or community levels:
Laws, policies, and regulations
Public funding, resource allocations, and procedures for determining funding levels
State and district administrative offices, school facilities, and transportation vehicles
Human resources, staffing, contracts, compensation, and employee benefits
Books, computers, teaching resources, and other learning materials
And, of course, countless other contributing elements
While the term education system is widely and frequently used in news media and public discourse, it may be difficult to determine precisely what the term is referring to when it is used without qualification, specific examples, or additional explanation.
